    backend traffic just refilling /static across the planet. The split below
    pins each path class to a TTL appropriate to how often the content can
    actually change:

      /static/*    immutable, 1y           — sprite/image filenames are stable;
                                             re-renders are rare and handled by

                                             path.
      /qa/*        max-age=86400            — temporary card-render QA mount.
                                             ~576 normal + ~543 upgrade PNGs at

                                             reviews near-instant. When new

                                             runs, claim flow, sign-in state).

                                             bypasses on cookie heuristics but
                                             the origin should declare intent

      /api/presence  no-store             - live "who is in a run now" feed:
                                             30s heartbeats, 90s server TTL.
                                             Any shared caching makes the
                                             roster lie; the generic /api/*
                                             hour froze the first-ever empty
                                             response at the edge (2026-06-12).
      /api/runs/*  s-maxage=30             — user-submitted runs need to appear
                                             in lists/leaderboards within a
                                             minute, not an hour.
      /api/*       s-maxage=3600           — entity data only changes on deploy
                                             (every few days). Browsers still
                                             revalidate every 5 min via max-age.
      /metrics     no-store                 — Prometheus scrapes the public URL
      /health      no-store                   every 30s; CF's default 4h
                                             heuristic was freezing the scrape
                                             on a 4h-old snapshot, making
                                             counters appear stuck and gauges
                                             rewind on cache refresh.

    Endpoints that set Cache-Control themselves win: the middleware only
    fills in a default when the handler didn't declare one. Several handlers
    rely on that (snapshot-status at no-store, community-stats and metrics
    flipping to no-store while the stats snapshot rebuilds) and were being
    silently overwritten, which let the edge cache empty rebuild-window
    responses despite their own guards.

    Cache headers are only applied to successful GETs. Caching 4xx/5xx on
    /static would prevent recovery by simply uploading the missing file.

# in-order route matching reaches the more-specific prefix first
# (otherwise the broader `/static` mount catches every URL and the
# StaticFiles 404 short-circuits before this mount sees the request).
# On the stable backend DATA_DIR is the unversioned `./data` tree (no

# harmless — its contents mirror what the API already serves as JSON.
