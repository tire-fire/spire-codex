"""Co-occurrence / synergy pairings across cards, relics, and potions.

"Players who take X usually also take Y." Decoupled on purpose from the
entity-stats snapshot walk (which is memory-heavy and rebuilds every couple of
hours): the underlying draft patterns only shift on game patches, so this is an
infrequent, cached job. It streams official runs from Mongo, counts how often
each pair of items lands in the same run, and scores the pairs. Results are
stored per item (top-N partners) for the card / relic pages to read in O(1).

Metrics, per unordered pair (a, b) over N official runs:
  co          runs containing both a and b
  P(a)        count[a] / N                      base rate of a
  P(a, b)     co / N
  PMI         log( P(a,b) / (P(a) P(b)) )
  NPMI        PMI / -log P(a,b)                 in [-1, 1]; >0 synergy, 0 = independent,
                                                <0 = actively avoided together
  conf        co / count[this]                  directional: of decks with THIS
                                                item, fraction that also run the partner
  conf_rev    co / count[partner]               the other direction, P(this | partner);
                                                both are stored so neither is missed
  winrate     wins_together / co                the pair's win rate

Cards and relics are drafted, so their co-occurrence is a real synergy signal
and is ranked by NPMI. Potions are RNG drops (we only count ones the player
actually took), so their signal is weaker — they're ranked by raw frequency and
surfaced as "commonly seen with", not a synergy claim. Pairs below a per-type
support floor are dropped so rare-but-always-together noise never shows up.
