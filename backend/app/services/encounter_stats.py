"""Per-encounter combat stats for `/api/runs/encounter-stats`.

Precomputed in the same all-runs walk as the entity / community / charts
stats (`run_entity_stats._build_cache_data`), carried through the shared
Mongo snapshot, and rolled up per request. This replaces the live
triple-``$unwind`` aggregation that walked every run's `map_point_history`
on each request — once the run count grew, that walk blew past the 60s
gateway timeout and the endpoint started returning 504s.

Each combat room in a run's `map_point_history` contributes one sample to
its ``(encounter, act, room_type)`` bucket, split by character and by
solo/multiplayer so the request-time filters (`acts`, `room_types`,
`multiplayer`) can slice the precomputed cells without another walk.

Only official runs feed the accumulator: the walk that calls
`accumulate` already skips Ascension 11+ and non-official-character runs,
so modded runs stay out of the encounter table like the rest of the
stats.
