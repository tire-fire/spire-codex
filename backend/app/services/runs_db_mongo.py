    Walks each run's `map_point_history` (array of acts → array of rooms),

    per-character breakdown.

    Filters:
      * `acts` — restrict to specific act numbers (1, 2, 3). None = all.
      * `room_types` — restrict to "monster" / "elite" / "boss". None = all.
      * `multiplayer` — "only" / "exclude" / None (no filter). Multiplayer
        detection uses `player_count > 1` since the run docs are one per
        player and `player_count` is denormalized at submit time.

    Pagination is applied AFTER grouping (we always compute all
    encounters then slice), since the total ordering by sample size is
    what determines the page contents.

    Each returned row carries enough numbers to populate the listing's
    primary columns (total runs that encountered it, fatal count, avg
    damage, avg turns) plus a `characters` map shaped
    `{IRONCLAD: {total, fatal, ...}, SILENT: {...}, ...}` for the
    expanded per-character sub-table.

    Fatal detection: a run "died here" when the run's `killed_by` field
    matches the encounter id. This is an approximation — the same enemy
    type can appear earlier in the same run and we'd attribute the death
    to all instances. PR #266's extract logic narrows this to the *last*
    matching room; we settle for the simpler heuristic here since the
