"""Per-entity run statistics — cached aggregator.

For each relic / card / potion, walks every submitted run JSON once,
counts how many runs include it (per character), how many of those
runs were wins, and tracks the most-recent submission. The result is
served from `/api/runs/stats/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` to power the
"Stats" tab on each detail page.

Cache strategy:
- First request triggers a full walk of `data/runs/*.json` joined
  against the runs DB (for character, win, submitted_at, run_hash).
- Result lives in process memory keyed by (entity_type, entity_id).
- TTL is `_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`; a request after expiry kicks off a
  rebuild. Rebuild is single-shot (a re-entry while building gets the
  stale snapshot and skips the rebuild).
- Run submissions are infrequent enough that a 30-minute TTL is fine
  without invalidation hooks.
