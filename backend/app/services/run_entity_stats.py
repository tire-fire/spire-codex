"""Per-entity run statistics — cached aggregator.

For each relic / card / potion, walks every submitted run JSON once,
counts how many runs include it (per character), how many of those
runs were wins, and tracks the most-recent submission. The result is
served from `/api/runs/stats/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` to power the
"Stats" tab on each detail page.

Cache strategy:
- The heavy walk of `data/runs/*.json` (100k+ files) runs in a SINGLE
  leader process via the existing stats-refresher Mongo lease, and the
  result is persisted to the `entity_stats_snapshot` collection.
- Every worker reads that shared snapshot into process memory (keyed by
  (entity_type, entity_id)) instead of walking the files itself. This
  is what stops N workers each pegging a CPU rebuilding the same data
  and serving inconsistent (some empty) tier lists.
- Workers reload the snapshot every `_SNAPSHOT_LOAD_SECONDS`; the leader
  rebuilds it every `_SNAPSHOT_REBUILD_SECONDS`.
- On the SQLite path (no Mongo) there's no shared snapshot, so each
  process builds locally on demand — fine at that scale.
