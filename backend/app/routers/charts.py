"""Charts API: pre-aggregated run data for the /charts explorer page.

Every endpoint returns a small, ready-to-plot payload:
{ chart, params, series: [{id, label, points: [{x, y, n?}]}], total_runs }

Metadata charts aggregate the in-memory run frame per request (fast), support
splitting series by character / player count / outcome / ascension band, and
the results are cached. Blob charts (per-floor curves, encounter damage,
event outcomes, per-entity stats) read the snapshot accumulated during the
regular stats walk, or walk a single user's blobs on demand when `username`
is set.
