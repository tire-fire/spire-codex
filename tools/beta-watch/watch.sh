# Beta-watch: poll Steam for a new StS2 beta build. On detection, run the
# extraction + parse + diff pipeline, push a branch, open a PR, and ping
# Discord. Idempotent — runs every 30 min via launchd, no-op when up to date.
#
# Setup is documented in README.md. State (last-seen buildid, logs) lives
# at $STATE_DIR. The script must be runnable without an interactive TTY,
# so Steam Guard credentials need to be cached (steamcmd remembers after
# the first login — keep your credential file warm).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   No new build, or new build fully processed.
#   2   SteamCMD failed (network, auth, Steam down).
#   3   New build detected but extraction/parse pipeline failed.
#   4   Pipeline succeeded but git/gh/Discord step failed.
