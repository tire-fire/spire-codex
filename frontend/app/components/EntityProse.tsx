/**
 * Programmatic prose block at the bottom of each entity's Overview
 * tab. The prose is English-only, every locale used to render the
 * SAME English boilerplate text on top of localized chrome, which
 * Google's algorithm reads as duplicate content across translations
 * and dumps the localized variants into "Crawled - currently not
 * indexed" (~7,000 pages affected).
 *
 * Behavior now:
 * - English: full prose (60-100 words of factual contextual content
 *   to push the page past Google's "thin content" floor)
 * - Non-English: a single sentence built ENTIRELY from already-
 *   localized API fields (name, rarity, pool, translated server-
 *   side per language). No English connective text. This ensures
 *   each locale's page body is genuinely different from the others
 *   while still adding minimal SEO weight beyond the bare description.
 *
 * Long-term, full localized prose templates would be ideal, but
 * those require professional translation of ~30 sentence patterns
 * × 14 languages. Until then, this asymmetry preserves indexation.
 *
 * Three discriminated variants below; each entity detail page picks
 * the one that matches its data shape.
