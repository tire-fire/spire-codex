# Spire Codex prod .env template — rendered by `op inject` at deploy time.
#
# Lines using a 1Password secret reference (vault/item/field path) are
# resolved at render time. Plain values are kept as-is. Update the
# field names below to match your actual 1Password item layout
# (right-click any field in the 1Password app and "Copy Secret
# Reference" to get the exact path).
#
# NOTE: don't put a literal "op:" + "//" sequence in any comment in this
# file — op-inject parses every occurrence and bails on malformed ones.
#
# This file is safe to commit — only the resolved-at-runtime version
# (written to /tmp during the playbook run, deleted immediately after)
# contains real secrets.

# MongoDB — runs database. Hosted on the secondary Lightsail box as a
