# Hourly auto-deploy for spire-codex prod. Polls origin/main; if HEAD
# advanced, pulls Docker images and recreates the backend+frontend
# containers. After a clean restart, purges Cloudflare cache so /news,
# /api/news, sitemap.xml, etc. immediately reflect the new build.
#
# Installed by playbooks/install-autodeploy.yml. Triggered by
# /etc/cron.d/spire-codex-autodeploy. Manual run: just exec this script.
#
# Idempotent: same-HEAD ticks no-op and don't log unless DEBUG=1.
# `--force` overrides that: full deploy (pull, prewarm, recreate, nginx
# reload, CF purge) even with no new commit. Used for manual releases
# right after a merge (./tools/startup.sh release) and for re-pulling a
# rebuilt image on the same commit.

  # Detect whether this update needs a container recreate at all. Two
  # classes don't:
  #
  #   data/news/*  : the compose file mounts ./data:/data and the news API
  #                  re-reads from disk on every request.
  #   data-beta/*  : the beta catalogs are cached keyed BY VERSION and the
  #                  `latest` pointer is re-read per request, so a new
  #                  beta ingest (the beta-watch auto-PR) starts serving
  #                  the moment the files land on disk. Exception: a
  #                  re-parse of an EXISTING version keeps its cache key;
  #                  bounce the backend manually after one of those.
  #
  # Skipping the recreate saves ~30s of downtime for the two most frequent
  # update classes. Anything else (code, stable data files cached
  # without a version key so they need the restart, images, frontend,
