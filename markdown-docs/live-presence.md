# Live presence ("who is in a run right now")

The in-game SpireCodex mod heartbeats each player's in-progress run to the backend every
~30 seconds. The backend keeps one Mongo doc per live player with a 90 second TTL, so
quits and crashes fall off the list on their own. This doc is the contract for building
the frontend view; the backend half is done (`app/routers/presence.py`,
`app/services/presence_db.py`).

## Endpoints

### GET /api/presence/active

Public. The roster for a "Live now" rail or /live page. Deepest run first.

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "players": [
    {
      "steam_id": "7656119...",
      "username": "ptrlrd",
      "character": "NECROBINDER",
      "ascension": 3,
      "act": 2, "act_floor": 7, "total_floor": 23,
      "hp": 23, "max_hp": 75, "gold": 142,
      "screen": "combat",
      "seed": "ABC123",
      "player_count": 1,
      "sts2_version": "v0.103.3+460a0ece",
      "started_at": "2026-06-11T19:02:11+00:00",
      "updated_at": "2026-06-11T19:14:41+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

`?limit=` caps the list (default 50, max 100). Numeric fields can be absent on a sparse
heartbeat; render defensively. `started_at` is the first heartbeat of the session, good
for "climbing for 41 min".

### GET /api/presence/{steam_id}

Public. The full live doc for one player: everything above plus `deck` (card ids, `+`
suffix = upgraded, e.g. `"STRIKE+"`), `relics`, and `potions` (bare ids). 404 when the
player is not live. This is the data for a per-player live run view (spectator-lite,
refresh every 10-15s).

Combat context (v2, absent between fights):

- `turn`: the combat round number
- `fighting`: bare ids of the living enemies, e.g. `["GREMLIN_NOB"]`

Play-by-play ticker (v2): `events` is a rolling window (last 50) of moments, oldest
first, appended by each heartbeat:

```json
"events": [
  {"k": "combat", "turn": 1, "t": 1781650000},
  {"k": "card", "v": "WHIRLWIND", "turn": 2, "t": 1781650031},
  {"k": "potion", "v": "FIRE_POTION", "turn": 3, "t": 1781650055},
  {"k": "victory", "t": 1781650070},
  {"k": "buy", "v": "FROZEN_EYE", "t": 1781650120}
]
```

Kinds: `card` (played), `potion` (used), `combat` (fight started), `victory`,
`buy` (shop purchase; `v` may be absent), `death` (the player died), `act` (entered a
new act). `v` is a bare entity id for the usual name/image lookups. Render as a feed:
"Turn 2 - played Whirlwind". The mod beats every ~12s during combat and ~30s outside
it, so poll this endpoint at 10-15s for a live-feeling ticker.

### POST /api/presence

Mod-only; requires the Steam JWT (`Authorization: Bearer`). The frontend never calls it.
503 until MONGO_URL is set, 401 without a valid token.

## Notes for the frontend

- Poll `/active` every 15-30s. No websockets; the data only changes on a ~30s beat.
- Entries are at most 90s stale by construction; no client-side freshness math needed.
- `screen` is the mod's coarse location: combat, map, merchant, event, rest, etc.
- Privacy is handled upstream: only players who opted into uploads (consent gate), kept
  Share live status on, and are Steam-signed-in ever appear here.
- Card/relic/potion ids are bare game ids (same convention as run docs) — the usual
  image/name lookups apply.
